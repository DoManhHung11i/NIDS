## Project Overview
This project proposes a novel defense mechanism to protect Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) from adversarial attacks. By integrating **Moving Target Defense (MTD)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, the system dynamically adapts its configurations to mitigate threats while optimizing defense strategies. The codebase includes implementations of the proposed algorithms, experimental setups, and evaluation scripts.
